## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Free Tier Limitations:
- ✅ 750 hours/month (enough for 24/7)
- ⚠️ App sleeps after 15 min of inactivity
- ⚠️ First request after sleep: 30-60 sec to wake
- ⚠️ SQLite database resets on each deploy

### For Production:
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month) for:
  - No sleep
  - Persistent disk
  - Better performance
- Or add PostgreSQL database (free tier available)

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment:

### In Render Dashboard:
- **Logs**: See real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory usage
- **Events**: Deployment history
- **Settings**: Environment variables, custom domain

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### Build Failed?
1. Check logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify all files pushed to GitHub
3. Check `requirements.txt` is correct

### App Not Loading?
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for first deploy
2. Check application logs
3. Try accessing `/` to wake up app

### Database Empty?

- For permanent data, use PostgreSQL
